#Simple landing page
Description: Create a landing page following the given design (Figma).

#Requirements:

Use of semantic tags wherever is necessary
All fonts, color palette, elements sizes must strictly match the design.
Pixel perfect is also not required, BUT your website should visually match the design template (i.e. If the element is horizontally centered on the design, it should look centered on the website)
All class names must not be meaningless (i.e. class=”myClass”) and should follow the same naming convention, preferably BEM, but you could come up with your own (just be consistent)
Basic cross-browser support (website should look correctly on last versions of modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge)
For now, responsiveness is not required.
